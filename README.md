## 3. Usage

### LinkedIn Company Directory Scraper

Run the LinkedIn Company Directory Scraper using the following command:

```bash
scrapy crawl linkedin_directory_scraper -O directory_data.json
```

The scraped company directory data will be stored in the `directory_data.json` file in a structured JSON format or use `directory_data.csv`, according to your convinience.

### LinkedIn Company Profile Scraper

To Populate the list of companies you want to get information about, it's important to understand that the `company_profile_scraper.py` is supposed to take list of company names, through which it grabs the respective linkedin urls from the `directorydata.json` that scrapes the specific urls.

Go to `company_profile_scraper.py` and add your list of companies in the given `desired_company_names` list. You can add as many as you like!

```python
desired_company_names = ["Microsoft", "OpenAI"] # Please make sure to check the spellings of the names given
```

Run the LinkedIn Company Profile Scraper using the following command:

```bash
scrapy crawl company_profile_scraper -O company_profile_data.json
```

The scraped company profile data will be stored in the `company_profile_data.json` file in a structured JSON format.
